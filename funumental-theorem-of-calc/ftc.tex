    The Fundumental Theorem of Calculus is a theorem which links the concepts of differentiation and integration of functions. 
    The Fundumental Theorem of Calculus is broken into two parts.

    \subsection{Definition}
    If $f(x)$ is continuous over an interval $[a,b]$, and the function $F(x)$ is defined by 
    \[F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt,\]
    then $F'(x) = f(x)$ over $[a,b]$. \textbf{NEED CITATION FROM LIBRE TEXT}
